## Tweaks by Dean Attali:  

- Removed many unnecessary features 
- Removed dependency on images and made the colour picker completely CSS
- Added "showColour" setting which determines if to show the selected colour as the text, as the background colour of the input field, or both

Modified plugin is being used in [shinyjs](https://github.com/daattali/shinyjs/) - an R package for easily performing JavaScript operations in shiny applications.
